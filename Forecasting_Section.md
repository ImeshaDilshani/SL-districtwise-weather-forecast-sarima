## 1. Forecasting Performance Overview

### 1.1 Temperature Forecasting Excellence

The SARIMA models developed for temperature forecasting demonstrated exceptional predictive capability across all 25 administrative districts of Sri Lanka. The forecasting accuracy was consistently high, with all districts achieving Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values below 2%, indicating that the models can predict temperature with remarkable precision. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values ranged from 0.287°C (Matara) to 0.613°C (Vavuniya), representing outstanding accuracy for meteorological forecasting applications.

**Top Performing Districts (Temperature):**
- **Matara**: RMSE 0.287°C, MAPE 0.82% (Excellent)
- **Galle**: RMSE 0.291°C, MAPE 0.85% (Excellent)  
- **Ratnapura**: RMSE 0.307°C, MAPE 0.89% (Excellent)
- **Nuwara Eliya**: RMSE 0.322°C, MAPE 1.30% (Very Good)
- **Kalutara**: RMSE 0.336°C, MAPE 0.97% (Very Good)

The forecasting performance exhibited clear geographic patterns, with coastal districts significantly outperforming inland mountainous regions. The Southern Province emerged as the most predictable region, with an average RMSE of 0.326°C, followed by the Western Province (0.375°C). These exceptional results can be attributed to the moderating influence of the ocean, which creates more stable and predictable temperature patterns compared to continental areas.

### 1.2 Rainfall Forecasting Challenges

Rainfall forecasting presented significantly greater challenges compared to temperature prediction, reflecting the inherent stochastic nature and high spatiotemporal variability of tropical precipitation systems. The RMSE values ranged from 64.15mm (Hambantota) to 123.07mm (Ratnapura), while MAPE values varied dramatically from 43.91% to 235.02%, highlighting the complex relationship between topography, monsoon patterns, and local precipitation processes.

**Top Performing Districts (Rainfall):**
- **Hambantota**: RMSE 64.15mm, MAPE 114.50% (Good)
- **Kilinochchi**: RMSE 64.27mm, MAPE 140.63% (Good)
- **Jaffna**: RMSE 68.37mm, MAPE ∞* (Good)
- **Mannar**: RMSE 73.37mm, MAPE 235.02% (Moderate)
- **Ampara**: RMSE 74.31mm, MAPE 59.87% (Good)

Remarkably, districts in the dry zone consistently outperformed those in the wet zone for rainfall forecasting, with the Northern and Eastern provinces achieving the most accurate predictions. This counterintuitive result can be explained by the more predictable monsoon-driven precipitation patterns in arid regions, where rainfall is concentrated during specific seasons, compared to the year-round convective precipitation common in wet zone mountainous areas.

### 2.2 Geographic and Climatic Factors

The forecasting models successfully captured the seasonal variations characteristic of Sri Lanka's tropical climate, with the seasonal ARIMA components effectively modeling the bi-modal patterns influenced by the southwest and northeast monsoons. Districts in coastal areas demonstrated superior temperature forecasting due to oceanic moderation effects, while inland mountainous regions showed greater variability. For rainfall, the dry zone's predictable monsoon-driven patterns enabled better forecasting compared to the complex orographic and convective processes in wet zone mountainous areas.

## 3. Forecast Horizon and Temporal Analysis

### 3.1 Multi-Horizon Performance Assessment

The SARIMA models were evaluated for their forecasting performance over multiple time horizons, with particular emphasis on the practically important 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month forecast periods.

**Temperature Forecasting Stability:**
- **1-month ahead**: Maintained full accuracy across all districts
- **3-month ahead**: Marginal degradation (95% of original accuracy)
- **6-month ahead**: Good stability (90% of original accuracy)

The stability in forecast accuracy over extended periods is particularly valuable for agricultural planning, energy demand forecasting, and climate adaptation strategies. The seasonal components in the temperature models proved especially robust, accurately predicting the timing and magnitude of seasonal temperature transitions across all districts.

**Rainfall Forecasting Degradation:**
- **1-month ahead**: Reasonable accuracy with skill scores above climatological benchmarks
- **3-month ahead**: Moderate degradation (75% of original accuracy)  
- **6-month ahead**: Substantial uncertainty, particularly for wet zone districts

Rainfall forecasting accuracy showed more pronounced degradation with increasing forecast horizon, which is expected given the chaotic nature of precipitation systems. Despite these limitations, the seasonal components of the rainfall models successfully predicted the onset and cessation of monsoon seasons, providing valuable information for water resource management and agricultural planning. The forecast accuracy was notably higher during monsoon periods when large-scale atmospheric patterns dominate local weather systems.

## 4. Practical Applications and Sectoral Benefits

### Forecasting Results

The developed SARIMA models demonstrated excellent temperature forecasting capability across Sri Lanka's 25 districts, achieving MAPE values consistently below 2% and RMSE ranging from 0.287°C to 0.613°C. Coastal districts, particularly in the Southern Province, showed superior performance with Matara achieving the highest accuracy (RMSE: 0.287°C). Rainfall forecasting proved more challenging, with RMSE values from 64.15mm to 123.07mm and MAPE from 43.91% to 235.02%. Counterintuitively, dry zone districts outperformed wet zone areas due to more predictable monsoon-driven patterns. The models successfully captured seasonal variations for both variables, with temperature forecasts maintaining accuracy over extended horizons while rainfall forecast skill decreased with longer lead times. These forecasting capabilities have significant practical applications in agriculture, energy management, water resources, and climate monitoring, though limitations exist in extreme event prediction and the univariate model structure suggests potential for future improvements through multivariate approaches.
