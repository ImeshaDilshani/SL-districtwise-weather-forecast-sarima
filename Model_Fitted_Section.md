## Model Fitting Results and Performance Analysis

The SARIMA model fitting process was successfully completed for all 25 administrative districts of Sri Lanka, resulting in district-specific models for both temperature and rainfall forecasting. For temperature forecasting, the fitted models demonstrated exceptional performance across all districts, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.287°C (Matara) to 0.613°C (Vavuniya), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) consistently below 2% for all locations. The most common model specification for temperature was ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,1)[12], indicating that a simple autoregressive structure with seasonal differencing and moving average components effectively captured the temporal patterns in Sri Lankan temperature data. Notably, coastal districts in the Southern and Western provinces exhibited superior forecasting accuracy, with the top five performing districts—Matara, Galle, Ratnapura, Nuwara Eliya, and Kalutara—achieving RMSE values below 0.34°C and MAPE values below 1.3%. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values for temperature models ranged from 90.51 to 331.34, with lower values consistently observed in coastal regions, suggesting that these areas exhibit more predictable temperature patterns.

In contrast, rainfall forecasting presented significantly greater challenges due to the inherent variability and intermittent nature of precipitation data. The fitted SARIMA models for rainfall achieved RMSE values ranging from 64.15mm (Hambantota) to 123.07mm (Ratnapura), with MAPE values exhibiting substantial variation from 43.91% to 235.02%, reflecting the complex stochastic nature of tropical rainfall patterns. The predominant model specification for rainfall was characterized by seasonal autoregressive components (2,0,0)[12] with various non-seasonal structures, indicating the critical importance of capturing annual monsoon cycles in Sri Lankan precipitation modeling. Interestingly, districts in the dry zone (Northern and Eastern provinces) demonstrated relatively better rainfall forecasting performance, with Hambantota, Kilinochchi, and Jaffna achieving the lowest RMSE values. This superior performance in arid regions can be attributed to the more predictable precipitation patterns during monsoon seasons compared to the highly variable rainfall in wet zone mountainous areas. The AIC values for rainfall models ranged from 1857.75 to 2176.56, with 13 out of 25 districts requiring non-zero mean specifications, indicating the prevalence of stationary rainfall processes around long-term averages rather than zero-mean processes.

The model selection process, guided by systematic comparison of AIC, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and residual diagnostics, revealed distinct regional patterns in optimal model specifications. Temperature models predominantly featured AR(1) non-seasonal components (14 out of 25 districts), suggesting consistent day-to-day temperature dependencies across Sri Lanka, while seasonal components varied between (2,1,0)[12] and (2,1,1)[12] patterns, reflecting regional differences in annual temperature cycles. Four districts required drift terms in their temperature models, primarily in mountainous regions experiencing long-term climatic trends. Rainfall models exhibited greater complexity, with equal prevalence of AR(3) and ARIMA(1,0,2) non-seasonal specifications (5 districts each), indicating more intricate temporal dependencies in precipitation processes. The requirement for seasonal differencing in 8 out of 25 rainfall models highlighted the non-stationary nature of monsoon patterns, while 3 districts necessitated drift components, predominantly in the Northern Province where long-term precipitation trends were evident. All fitted models successfully passed residual diagnostic tests, including the Ljung-Box test for serial correlation and normality assessments, confirming the adequacy of the selected SARIMA specifications for capturing the underlying temporal structures in Sri Lankan weather data. The comprehensive model fitting exercise demonstrates the effectiveness of SARIMA methodology for national-scale weather forecasting while highlighting the distinct climatic characteristics of different geographic regions within Sri Lanka.

## Alternative Shorter Version (if space is limited):

The SARIMA model fitting process yielded highly effective forecasting models for all 25 administrative districts of Sri Lanka, with distinct performance characteristics between temperature and rainfall predictions. Temperature models achieved exceptional accuracy with RMSE values ranging from 0.287°C to 0.613°C and MAPE consistently below 2%, predominantly following ARIMA(1,0,0)(2,1,1)[12] specifications that effectively captured seasonal temperature patterns. Coastal districts demonstrated superior performance, with the Southern Province achieving the lowest average RMSE of 0.326°C. Rainfall forecasting proved more challenging due to precipitation variability, with RMSE values ranging from 64.15mm to 123.07mm and MAPE from 43.91% to 235.02%. The optimal rainfall models typically featured seasonal AR(2) components with various non-seasonal structures, and surprisingly, dry zone districts outperformed wet zone locations in forecast accuracy. Model selection based on AIC criteria and residual diagnostics confirmed the appropriateness of the fitted SARIMA specifications, with all models passing statistical validation tests for adequacy and revealing meaningful regional patterns in Sri Lankan climate dynamics.
