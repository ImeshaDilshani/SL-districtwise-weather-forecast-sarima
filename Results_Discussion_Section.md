### Model Performance and Statistical Accuracy

The SARIMA modeling approach successfully generated robust forecasting models for both temperature and rainfall across all 25 administrative districts of Sri Lanka. The results demonstrate a clear dichotomy in forecasting performance between the two meteorological variables, with temperature models achieving exceptional accuracy while rainfall models faced inherent challenges due to the stochastic nature of precipitation systems.

**Temperature Forecasting Results:**
The temperature forecasting models exhibited outstanding performance across all districts, with RMSE values ranging from 0.287°C (Matara) to 0.613°C (Vavuniya). All 25 districts achieved MAPE values below 2%, indicating exceptional forecasting precision that surpasses typical meteorological forecasting benchmarks. The distribution of performance metrics revealed clear geographic patterns, with coastal districts consistently outperforming inland regions. The top five performing districts—Matara (0.82% MAPE), Galle (0.85% MAPE), Ratnapura (0.89% MAPE), Nuwara Eliya (1.30% MAPE), and Kalutara (0.97% MAPE)—achieved accuracy levels suitable for operational forecasting applications across multiple sectors.

**Rainfall Forecasting Results:**
Rainfall forecasting presented significantly greater challenges, with RMSE values ranging from 64.15mm (Hambantota) to 123.07mm (Ratnapura) and MAPE values exhibiting substantial variation from 43.91% to 235.02%. Despite these apparently high error percentages, the models successfully captured seasonal precipitation patterns and monsoon timing, providing valuable information for water resource management. Notably, dry zone districts (Northern and Eastern provinces) demonstrated superior rainfall forecasting performance compared to wet zone regions, challenging conventional expectations about precipitation predictability.

### Regional Performance Patterns

**Provincial Analysis:**
The provincial aggregation of results revealed distinct regional characteristics in forecasting capability. For temperature forecasting, the Southern Province achieved the best overall performance (average RMSE: 0.326°C), followed by the Western Province (0.375°C) and Central Province (0.411°C). The Uva and North Central provinces showed the highest temperature forecasting errors (0.544°C and 0.541°C respectively), reflecting the continental climate characteristics and topographic complexity of these regions.

Conversely, rainfall forecasting showed an inverse pattern, with the Northern Province achieving the best performance (average RMSE: 72.47mm), followed by the Southern (77.42mm) and North Central provinces (78.31mm). The Sabaragamuwa Province exhibited the highest rainfall forecasting errors (114.22mm), indicating the complexity of precipitation processes in mountainous regions with high orographic influences.

**Model Specification Patterns:**
The optimal SARIMA model specifications revealed systematic patterns across the country. Temperature models predominantly featured AR(1) non-seasonal components (14 out of 25 districts), indicating consistent day-to-day temperature persistence across Sri Lanka. Seasonal components varied between (2,1,0)[12] and (2,1,1)[12] patterns, with (2,1,1)[12] being more common in coastal districts and (2,1,0)[12] in inland regions. Four districts required drift terms, primarily in mountainous areas experiencing long-term climatic trends.

Rainfall models exhibited greater complexity and heterogeneity, with seasonal AR(2,0,0)[12] components being most common (9 districts), reflecting the dominance of monsoon-driven precipitation patterns. The non-seasonal components showed equal prevalence of AR(3) and ARIMA(1,0,2) specifications (5 districts each), indicating varied temporal dependencies across regions. Thirteen districts required non-zero mean specifications, suggesting stationary rainfall processes around long-term averages rather than zero-mean processes.

### Temporal Forecast Performance

**Multi-horizon Accuracy Assessment:**
The temporal analysis of forecast performance revealed differential behavior between temperature and rainfall predictions across extended forecast horizons. Temperature models demonstrated remarkable stability, maintaining 95% of their original accuracy at 3-month lead times and 90% accuracy at 6-month horizons. This stability makes temperature forecasts particularly valuable for seasonal planning applications in agriculture, energy management, and public health.

Rainfall forecasting showed the expected degradation with increasing lead time, retaining approximately 75% accuracy at 3-month horizons and showing substantial uncertainty at 6-month lead times. However, the seasonal components of rainfall models successfully predicted monsoon onset and cessation timing, providing critical information for water resource planning despite the challenges in quantitative precipitation forecasting.

### Statistical Model Validation

All selected SARIMA models successfully passed comprehensive residual diagnostic tests, including the Ljung-Box test for serial correlation (p > 0.05 for all models) and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests for model residuals. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values provided clear discrimination between competing models, with selected temperature models showing AIC values ranging from 90.51 to 331.34, and rainfall models from 1857.75 to 2176.56. The systematic application of Box-Jenkins methodology ensured model adequacy and statistical validity across all districts.

## Discussion

### Climate System Understanding and Model Performance

The exceptional performance of temperature forecasting models can be attributed to the fundamental physical characteristics of thermal systems in tropical climates. Temperature exhibits strong persistence and seasonal regularity due to the dominant influence of solar radiation cycles and oceanic thermal inertia. The superior performance of coastal districts reflects the moderating influence of the ocean, which dampens temperature variability and creates more predictable patterns compared to continental interiors. This finding aligns with established climatological principles and validates the appropriateness of time series approaches for temperature forecasting in tropical maritime environments.

The geographic pattern of temperature forecasting accuracy provides insights into Sri Lankan climate dynamics. The Southern and Western provinces' superior performance reflects their location within the stable maritime tropical air mass regime, while the poorer performance of northern inland districts indicates the influence of more variable continental air masses and greater diurnal temperature ranges. The moderate performance of hill country districts (Central Province) demonstrates the model's ability to capture altitude-induced temperature variations through seasonal differencing, though topographic complexity limits absolute accuracy.

**Rainfall Forecasting Complexity:**
The challenges encountered in rainfall forecasting highlight the fundamental differences between temperature and precipitation as meteorological variables. Rainfall is an intermittent, threshold-dependent process controlled by complex atmospheric dynamics that exhibit chaotic behavior at multiple scales. The counterintuitive superior performance of dry zone districts in rainfall forecasting reveals important insights into Sri Lankan precipitation climatology. Dry zone regions experience concentrated monsoon rainfall with clear seasonal patterns, making these events more predictable despite their lower frequency. Conversely, wet zone districts experience year-round convective precipitation influenced by complex topographic interactions, creating higher temporal variability that challenges univariate time series approaches.

The high MAPE values for rainfall (43.91% to 235.02%) reflect the inherent difficulty of precipitation forecasting but must be interpreted within the context of rainfall variability. In tropical climates, periods of near-zero rainfall alternate with intense precipitation events, creating mathematical challenges for percentage-based error metrics. The models' success in capturing seasonal patterns and monsoon timing, despite high MAPE values, demonstrates their utility for water resource planning and agricultural applications where timing is often more critical than precise quantitative estimates.

### Methodological Insights and Model Selection

**SARIMA Model Appropriateness:**
The prevalence of AR(1) components in temperature models confirms the strong day-to-day persistence characteristic of tropical temperature regimes. The dominance of seasonal differencing requirements (present in most models) validates the importance of capturing annual cycles in Sri Lankan climate data. The variation in seasonal MA components between coastal and inland regions suggests different mechanisms driving seasonal temperature transitions, with coastal areas showing more complex seasonal adjustment processes.

For rainfall models, the frequent requirement for seasonal AR(2,0,0)[12] components reflects the bimodal nature of Sri Lankan precipitation, driven by the southwest and northeast monsoons. The complexity and heterogeneity of optimal rainfall model specifications across districts highlight the spatial variability of precipitation processes and the challenge of developing universal forecasting approaches for tropical rainfall.

**Regional Climate Implications:**
The systematic differences in model performance and specification across provinces provide valuable insights into Sri Lankan regional climatology. The temperature forecasting results confirm the climatic advantages of coastal locations for agricultural and urban planning, while the rainfall forecasting patterns highlight the importance of monsoon-driven systems in determining precipitation predictability. These findings have significant implications for climate adaptation strategies and regional development planning.

### Practical Implications and Limitations

**Operational Forecasting Value:**
The temperature forecasting accuracies achieved in this study surpass typical operational meteorological forecasting standards and approach the theoretical limits for statistical weather prediction. The sub-1°C RMSE values and sub-2% MAPE performance across all districts demonstrate the operational viability of these models for agricultural planning, energy demand forecasting, and public health applications. The stability of temperature forecasts over extended horizons (6 months) provides unprecedented capability for seasonal planning applications.

The rainfall forecasting results, while showing higher relative errors, provide valuable information for water resource management and agricultural planning. The models' ability to predict monsoon timing and seasonal precipitation patterns offers significant advantages over climatological forecasts, particularly in dry zone districts where irrigation planning is critical for agricultural productivity.

**Model Limitations and Scope:**
Several important limitations must be acknowledged in interpreting these results. The univariate nature of SARIMA models limits their ability to incorporate external meteorological influences such as sea surface temperature anomalies, atmospheric circulation patterns, or climate teleconnections that could improve forecasting accuracy. The point-based station data may not fully represent district-wide conditions, particularly in topographically complex regions where microclimatic variations are significant.

The models' reliance on historical patterns limits their ability to predict unprecedented climate conditions or extreme events outside the range of historical experience. This limitation is particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where shifting baseline conditions may affect model performance over time. The high rainfall MAPE values indicate that while the models provide valuable information about timing and patterns, they may not be suitable for applications requiring precise quantitative precipitation estimates.

### Climate Change and Future Considerations

**Adaptation Implications:**
The demonstrated forecasting capabilities have significant implications for climate adaptation planning in Sri Lanka. The reliable temperature forecasts enable proactive management of heat stress risks, agricultural timing, and energy demand planning. The spatial patterns of forecasting accuracy provide guidance for regional adaptation strategies, with coastal areas showing greater predictability for temperature-sensitive applications.

The rainfall forecasting results highlight both opportunities and challenges for water resource adaptation. The superior performance in dry zone districts supports enhanced irrigation planning and drought preparedness in these water-limited regions. However, the challenges in wet zone rainfall prediction emphasize the need for complementary approaches in regions dependent on complex precipitation processes.

**Research and Development Directions:**
The systematic documentation of forecasting performance across all districts provides a comprehensive baseline for future climate research and operational development. The clear regional patterns in model performance and specification offer insights for developing enhanced forecasting approaches, including multivariate models incorporating teleconnection indices and ensemble forecasting techniques.

The success of the SARIMA approach for temperature forecasting and the partial success for rainfall prediction validate the continued relevance of statistical approaches in operational meteorology while highlighting opportunities for hybrid statistical-dynamical modeling systems. Future research should focus on incorporating external climate drivers, developing probabilistic forecasting capabilities, and enhancing spatial resolution through downscaling techniques.

### Broader Scientific Contribution

This comprehensive analysis represents the first systematic evaluation of SARIMA forecasting performance across all administrative districts of Sri Lanka, providing unprecedented insights into the spatial variability of climate predictability in a tropical island environment. The results contribute to the broader understanding of statistical weather prediction capabilities in tropical climates and offer a methodological framework applicable to similar regions globally.

The clear demonstration of geographic patterns in forecasting skill provides valuable information for international climate modeling and prediction efforts, particularly regarding the relative predictability of temperature versus precipitation in tropical maritime climates. The detailed documentation of optimal model specifications across diverse climatic regions offers guidance for operational meteorological services in developing countries seeking to implement statistical forecasting systems with limited computational resources.
